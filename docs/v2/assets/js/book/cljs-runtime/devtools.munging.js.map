devtools.munging\n  \"This namespace implements various heuristics to map Javascript names back to corresponding ClojureScript names.\n  The functionality here heavily depends on observed ClojureScript compiler and runtime behaviour (fragile!).\n  Answers given by functions in this namespace cannot be perfect because generated Javascript naming schemes produced by\n  ClojureScript compiler were not designed with easy reversibility in mind. We recommend this functionality to be used for\n  presentation in the UI only. The goal here is to provide user with more familiar view of runtime state of her app\n  in most common cases (on best effort basis).\n\n  Our main weapons in this uneven fight are:\n    1. munged function names as they appear in Javascript (generated by ClojureScript)\n    2. we can also analyze function sources accessible via .toString\n    3. special cljs$core$IFn$_invoke protocol props generated for multi-arity functions\n\n  We can also cheat and look at runtime state of browser environment to determine some answers about namespaces.\n\n  This code can be used only in non-advanced builds!\n\n  If you discovered breakage or a new case which should be covered by this code, please open an issue:\n    https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools/issues\"\n  (:refer-clojure :exclude [js-reserved?])\n  (:require-macros [devtools.munging :refer [get-fast-path-protocol-partitions-count\n                                             get-fast-path-protocols-lookup-table]]\n                   [devtools.oops :refer [oget ocall safe-call]])\n  (:require [clojure.string :as string]\n            [devtools.context :as context]\n            [goog.object :as gobj])\n  (:import [goog.string StringBuffer]))\n\n(declare collect-fn-arities)\n\n(def dollar-replacement \"~\ufe69~\")\n(def max-fixed-arity-to-scan 64)\n\n; -- helpers ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(defn ^:dynamic get-global-scope []\n  (context/get-root))\n\n(defn js-reserved?

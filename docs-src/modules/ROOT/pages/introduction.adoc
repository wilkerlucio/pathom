= Introduction

The `pathom` library provides a set of functionality for building robust parsers to
process link:http://edn-query-language.org[EQL] requests.

If you are not familiar with link:http://edn-query-language.org[EQL], check its docs for a general intro on `EDN Graph Queries`.

In case you are not sure what this library is for, check the xref:rationale.adoc[rationale]
to understand the motivations for it.

== Pathom 3

Hello, if you are new here, I suggest you have a look at link:https://github.com/wilkerlucio/pathom3[Pathom 3]!

Pathom 3 still in alpha, but it's the library that will get updated ahead, and most of the API is already
stable, Pathom 2 (current here) is only updating in case of bug fixes.

== What does it look like?

Let's start with a demo! Use the buttons to load pre-defined queries and feel free to
edit and try around (start typing inside the `[]` and it will auto-complete to help you explore the API!).

++++
<div x-app="interactive-parser" data-parser="intro.demo" class="loader">
[:answer-to-everything]
</div>
++++

Source code for this demo:

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$com/wsscode/pathom/book/intro/demo.cljs[]
----

I hope you had a good time playing around! The intention of this library is to make it
as easy as possible to implement API's like the one you saw you in the demo above.

== How it works

The following diagram illustrates the main pieces that make a `pathom` parser:

image::parser-diagram.png[]

To break down in parts, let's imagine we are processing the following request:

[source,clojure]
----
[:answer-to-everything :answer-plus-one]
----

=== Parser

The parser receives the whole query to process and iterates over each attribute calling
the reader on each one of them.

In our example, the parser receives the full query
`[:answer-to-everything :answer-plus-one]`.

=== Readers

A reader processes a single entry from the query, the entry can be a 
link:https://edn-query-language.org/eql/1.0.0/specification.html#_properties[property], a
link:https://edn-query-language.org/eql/1.0.0/specification.html#_joins[join] or an
link:https://edn-query-language.org/eql/1.0.0/specification.html#_idents[ident].
It is common to have a chain of readers (as shown in the photo and demo), when it's a chain,
it tries each reader in order. A reader can respond with either a value or signal the engine
that it can’t process the key, in which case, it triggers the next reader.

In our example, the reader gets called once for `:answer-to-everything` and then again with
`:answer-plus-one`.

=== Resolvers

Pathom is capable of traversing a graph of dependencies to resolve data.
This feature is called xref:connect.adoc[Connect] and each resolver is an edge of this
graph traversal. You can find more information about them in
xref:connect/resolvers.adoc[connect resolvers] docs.

=== Mutation

When you run EQL mutations, the mutate function will be called and the primary way to handle
them in pathom is by defining `Connect` mutations.

== In the `Pathom` library

The library includes:

* A composable xref:core/readers.adoc[reader abstraction].
* The concept of xref:core/entities.adoc[entity], which works as a base framework for reusable and sharable readers.
* A xref:plugins.adoc[plugin system] with some built-in plugins:
** xref:core/errors.adoc[Error handler]: Handles errors at an attribute level.
** xref:core/request-cache.adoc[Request cache]: For caching the results of possibly repetitive parsing which can happen on a single request.
** xref:core/trace.adoc[Tracer]: A plugin to measure and debug each step of the parsing process.
* xref:connect.adoc[Connect]: A higher-level abstraction that can resolve attribute relationships automatically. For
example, automatic traversal of database joins or resolving data through network requests.
This enables exploratory capabilities and a much simpler access model when the need arises to do
extra work for resolving a single conceptual join.
* xref:graphql.adoc[GraphQL integration]: Use GraphQL endpoints directly from your query system (in development).

Most people find the most leverage in the xref:connect.adoc[Connect] features, which
allows you to quickly build dynamic query processing systems to satisfy client data requests
with ease.

== Aliases Used in Code Examples

Throughout the book, our code examples use aliases instead of explicit namespaces. The
aliases used, assume that you have the following namespace requires in your environment:

```
(ns my-namespace
  (:require
    [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]
    [com.wsscode.pathom.connect :as pc]
    [com.wsscode.pathom.connect.graphql2 :as pcg]
    [com.wsscode.pathom.graphql :as pg]
    [com.wsscode.pathom.sugar :as ps]
    [com.wsscode.pathom.trace :as pt]
    ; clj only
    [com.wsscode.common.async-clj :refer [let-chan go-catch <? <?maybe]
    ; cljs only
    [com.wsscode.common.async-cljs :refer [let-chan <!p go-catch <? <?maybe]]))
```

So, any time you see the usage of a namespace in a keyword or a function like `p/parser` or `::p/reader` you should remember
that these are the namespaces involved.

== How to Use This Library

Most of our current user base is made up of `Fulcro` users, however this library is a stand-alone thing
that you can use to fulfill any system using EQL queries. The purpose of this library is to make it
much easier to build code that can process EQL on both the client and server-side.
We expect you to have one or more of the following needs:

* You want to fulfill a client UI query from some server-side data source(s).
* You want to build a client-side parser for directly filling local UI data queries from a local data source.
* You want to build a parser (client or server) that uses async APIs to fulfill different parts of a query. Perhaps
gluing together data sources from various micro-services.
* You want to use a GraphQL API from the client.
* You want to provide third-party users a GraphQL API (Future Work)

When building most parsers, you'll want to use xref:connect.adoc[Pathom Connect].

To process EQL queries against GraphQL you'll use the xref:graphql.adoc[GraphQL Integration].

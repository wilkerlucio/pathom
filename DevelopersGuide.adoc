= Getting Started

If you want to start writing your Om.next parser, you are in the right place! Let's get this code session started with
a hello world parser with pathom:

== Project setup

You can get a basic app with no prewritten demo code using:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns pathom-docs.hello-pathom
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

; this is our first reader
; a Clojure map represents a reader that will dispatch from the om dispatch key to the map key
(def computed
  ; here we define that for the dispatch-key :hello we are going to return "World"
  {:hello (fn [env] "World")})

(def parser
  ; initialize a pathom parser
  (p/parser {}))

; call the parser, we set the reader function
(parser {::p/reader computed} [:hello])
; => {:hello "World"}
----

Before we continue, I would like to talk to about some patterns on the graph parsing game, it will give you a better understanding of how/why this library is designed the way it is. When parsing a graph API like this, there are 3 major types of reading that you want to do at any level, let's talk about those:

1. *Entity attributes*: those are attributes present on the current entity (node) that is being parsed, for example, if we are in a `customer` node, it might have attributes like `:customer/id`, `:customer/name`, etc... So when the query asks for those we should fetch from the entity itself.
2. *Computed attributes*: when the desired key is not present on the entity map, we try to compute it from one (or many) other readers, those readers are usually maps (closed sets of attributes) or multimethods (open sets of attributes), and they have are configured to handle the keys by doing some process/computation. This one can be broken down into 2 categories:
    1. *Globals*: if the computed attribute doesn't depend on any data from the entity, it is global, and can be called from any point of the graph.
    2. *Derived attributes*: when the computed attribute depends on some property of the current entity, we call it a derivation. Derivations are often relationship mappings, like navigating to the `:customer/address`, or to a sub-list like `:customer/friends`, or just a computed property (apply some algorithm in a property to create a derived one).
3. *Entity lookups*: This is the om.next default way to look for an entity on the graph using the ident syntax (eg: `[:customer/id 123]`).

We gonna cover all of those types of reading in this getting started. Also, in more recent versions `Connect` was introduced,
it's a new approach to define the *Computed attributes*, we are going to talk all about it later, but the premisses
still the same.

> It's very important that you use unique names for your graph attributes, having contextual behavior drives you to bugs and confusion very quickly. Use qualified (namespaced) keywords as much as you can, make then long, make then unique, give them the same care you do about naming/namespacing your functions in Clojure, this will enable your API to integrate with others and keep working for a long time.

Next, let's start with the first 2 types mentioned before, entity and computed attributes.

; define some data of tv shows
(def tv-shows
  {:rm  #:tv-show{:title         "Rick and Morty"
                  :character-ids [:rick :summer :morty]}
   :bcs #:tv-show{:title         "Better Call Saul"
                  :character-ids [:bcs]}

   :morty   #:character{:name "Morty Smith" :tv-show-id :rm}
   :ygritte #:character{:name "Ygritte" :tv-show-id :got}})

; helper to illustrate what would be a function to your database or
; service, it's a good practice to send the entire environment, in this
; case we are getting the db, but having the entire env is often empowering
(defn characters-by-ids [{::keys [db]} ids]
  (map (get @db :characters) ids))

(def computed
  ; example of a global attribute, a random character from our
  ; "database" that can be fetched at any time
  {:characters/random
   ; pretend the db is your datomic database or a Postgres connection,
   ; anything that would enable you to reach the data
   (fn [{::keys [db] :as env}]
     ; take a hand of the entity we want to be the current node
     (let [character (rand-nth (-> @db :characters vals vec))]
       ; to parse the sub-query with the entity we use the join function
       (p/join character env)))

   ; example when you want to do go down the parser with a list of things
   ; very much like the single one, but using join-seq instead, in this case
   ; the main characters that we have on our list
   :characters/main
   (fn [env]
     ; since we decided to get the env in the characters-by-ids the argument
     ; passing is a brease
     (p/join-seq env (characters-by-ids env [:rick :morty :saul :arya])))

   ; an example of relashionship, extract the tv-show according to the :character/tv-show-id
   ; on the character entity
   :character/tv-show
   (fn [{::keys [db] :as env}]
     ; the p/entity-attr! will try to get the :character/tv-show from current entity
     ; if it's not there it will make a query for it using the same parser. If
     ; it can't be got it will trigger an exception with the issue details, making
     ; easier to identify the problem
     (let [tv-show-id (p/entity-attr! env :character/tv-show-id)]
       (p/join (some-> @db :tv-shows (get tv-show-id)) env)))

   ; example of making a computed property, this will get the number of
   ; characters in the current tv-show
   :tv-show/characters-count
   (fn [env]
     ; just give a count on members, and again, will raise exception if
     ; :tv-show/character-ids fails to be reached
     (count (p/entity-attr! env :tv-show/character-ids)))})

(def parser
  ; This time we are using the env-plugin to initialize the environment, this is good
  ; to set the defaults for your parser to be called. Also, we are attaching the built-in
  ; reader map-reader on the game, so it will read the keys from the entity map. Check
  ; Entity page on wiki for more information.
  (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [p/map-reader computed]})]}))

; call the parser, create and send our atom database
(parser {::db (atom {:characters characters
                     :tv-shows   tv-shows})}
        [{:characters/main [:character/name {:character/tv-show [:tv-show/title
                                                                 :tv-show/characters-count]}]}
         ; feeling lucky today?
         {:characters/random [:character/name]}])
; =>
; #:characters{:main   [#:character{:name "Rick Sanshes", :tv-show #:tv-show{:name "Rick and Morty", :characters-count 3}}

;              :random #:character{:name "Saul Goodman"}}
----

The previous example covered the most common processes you need on a graph API. The `map-reader` is responsible for reading the values on the *entity attributes*, when the value is not there the `computed` kicks in trying to compute the value if it's registered. In case no reader is able to respond, a value of `::p/not-found` will be returned.

Now it's time to add the *entity lookups* in the game. Add this right before the `(def parser ...` code.

[source,clojure]
----
; initialize a multi-method to handle entity queries
(defmulti entity p/entity-dispatch)

; default case returns ::p/continue to sign to pathom that
; this reader can't handle the given entry
(defmethod entity :default [_] ::p/continue)

; let's handle the load of characters by id
(defmethod entity :character/id [{::keys [db] :as env}]
  ; from the key [:character/id :rick], p/ident-value will return :rick
  (let [id (p/ident-value env)]
    ; same thing as would find a record by id on your database
    ; we return ::p/continue to signal this reader wans't able to
    ; fetch it entity, so the parser can try the next one, more about this
    ; on Readers with page
    (p/join (get-in @db [:characters id] ::p/continue) env)))

; same thing for tv shows
(defmethod entity :tv-show/id [{::keys [db] :as env}]
  (let [id (p/ident-value env)]
    (p/join (get-in @db [:tv-shows id] ::p/continue) env)))

(def parser
  ; add our entity reader to our reader list
  (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [p/map-reader
                                                     computed
                                                     entity]})]}))

; testing our new queries
(parser {::db (atom {:characters characters
                     :tv-shows   tv-shows})}
        [[:character/id :arya]
         {[:tv-show/id :rm]
          [:tv-show/title
           {:tv-show/characters [:character/name]}]}])
; =>
; {[:character/id :arya] #:character{:name "Arya Stark", :tv-show-id :got}
;  [:tv-show/id :rm]     #:tv-show{:title      "Rick and Morty"
;                                  :characters [#:character{:name "Rick Sanshes"}
;                                               #:character{:name "Summer Smith"}
;                                               #:character{:name "Morty Smith"}]}}
----

When you understand those building blocks, all you graph can be written with that. If your app is larger than a demo, instead of using a fixed map for the `computed`, you can use the `p/key-dispatch` which is like the `p/entity-dispatch` but for `dispatch-keys` (like the map keys). By doing that you can leave the nodes open for extension, and then split your definitions across multiple files. An example of that is available at [[dispatch helpers page|Dispatch helpers]].

Here is the complete code for the example:

[source,clojure]

(ns pathom-docs.hello-entities

                  :character-ids [:rick :summer :morty]}
   :bcs #:tv-show{:title         "Better Call Saul"
                  :character-ids [:bcs]}
   :got #:tv-show{:title         "Game of Thrones"
                  :character-ids [:arya :ygritte]}})

(def characters
  {:rick    #:character{:name "Rick Sanshes" :tv-show-id :rm}
   :summer  #:character{:name "Summer Smith" :tv-show-id :rm}
   :saul    #:character{:name "Saul Goodman" :tv-show-id :bcs}
   :arya    #:character{:name "Arya Stark" :tv-show-id :got}
   :morty   #:character{:name "Morty Smith" :tv-show-id :rm}
   :ygritte #:character{:name "Ygritte" :tv-show-id :got}})

(defn characters-by-ids [{::keys [db]} ids]
  (map (get @db :characters) ids))

(def computed

       (p/join character env)))

   :characters/main

== Readers

=== What is a reader?

A reader is a function that will process a single entry from the query. For example, given the following query:
`[:name :age]`. If you ask an `om.next` parser to read this, the reader function will be called twice; once for `:name` and another one for `:age`. Note that in the case of joins, the parser will only be called for the join entry, but not for it's children (not automatically), for example: given the query `[:name :age {:parent [:name :gender]}]`. The reader function will be called 3 times now, one for `:name`, one for `:age` and one for `:parent`, when reading `:parent`, your reader code is responsible for checking that it has a children query, and do a recursive call (or anything else you want to do to handle this join). During this documentation, we are going to see many ways to implement those readers, but before we move on, I like to say the difference between `om.next` readers and `pathom` readers.

In `om.next` a parse read functions has the following signature: `(fn [env dispatch-key params])`. In `pathom` we use a smaller version instead, which is: `(fn [env])`. This is major different, in `pathom` I decided to use a smaller signature, you can extract the `dispatch-key` and the `params` from the env, so there is no information loss:

```clojure
(get-in env [:ast :dispatch-key]) ; => dispatch-key
(get-in env [:ast :params]) ; => params
```

Also, in `om.next` you need to return the value wrapped in `{:value "your-content"}`. In `pathom` this wrapping is done automatically for you, just return the final value.

Besides accepting the 1-arity function, Clojure maps and vectors are taken as readers, see [Map dispatcher](#map-dispatcher) and [Vector dispacher](#vector-dispatcher-aka-composed-readers) for information on those respectively.

To wrap up, here is a formal definiton for a `pathom` reader:

```clojure
(s/def ::reader-map (s/map-of keyword? ::reader))
(s/def ::reader-seq (s/coll-of ::reader :kind vector?))
(s/def ::reader-fn (s/fspec :args (s/cat :env ::env)
                            :ret any?))

(s/def ::reader
  (s/or :fn ::reader-fn
        :map ::reader-map
        :list ::reader-seq))
```

=== Pathom dispatching

It's time to look at pathom reader types: `function`, `map` and `vector`.

==== Function dispatcher

This is the simplest one, a function that will take the environment.

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.fn-dispatch
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(defn read-value [{:keys [ast]}]
  (let [key (get ast :dispatch-key)]
    (case key
      :name "Saul"
      :family "Goodman"
      ; good pratice: return ::p/continue when your reader is unable
      ; to handle the request
      ::p/continue)))

(def parser (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader read-value})]}))

(parser {} [:name :family])
; => {:name "Saul" :family "Goodman"}
```

==== Map dispatcher

The pattern you saw in the previous example, to dispatch from a fixed list of options, is very common, so `pathom` makes this easier by supporting `Clojure maps` as reader functions, using it we can re-write the previous example as:

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.reader-map-dispatch
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(def user-reader
  {:name   (fn [_] "Saul")
   :family (fn [_] "Goodman")})

(def parser (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader user-reader})]}))

(parser {} [:name :family])
; => {:name "Saul" :family "Goodman"}
```

==== Vector dispatcher [aka composed readers]

Composing readers enables the creation of readers that can be very specific about their responsibility, creating a chain of possibilities. Let's learn how it works by example:

When you send a vector as a reader, pathom will walk each reader trying to parse the current attribute with it. In case the reader can handle the value, it will be returned, but it can also return the special value `::p/continue` to signal that *I could not handle this*, in which case pathom will try the next one on the list, until some reader respond or the readers are exhausted. Let's learn how it works by example:

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.reader-vector-dispatch
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

; a map dispatcher for the :name key
(def name-reader
  {:name   (fn [_] "Saul")})

; a map dispatcher for the :family key
(def family-reader
  {:family (fn [_] "Goodman")})

(def parser (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [name-reader family-reader]})]}))

(parser {} [:name :family :other])
; => {:name "Saul", :family "Goodman", :other :com.wsscode.pathom.core/not-found}
```

Note that the `map dispatcher` will return `::p/continue` if the key is not present there, this way we can chain many of them together. By the end, if no reader can handle the key (all readers exhausted returning `::p/continue`), `::p/not-found` will be returned.

When you write your readers, remember to return `::p/continue` when you figure you can't handle a given key. This way your reader will play nice in composition scenarios.

Pathom also provides a set of built-in readers to handle common scenarios, check them at [[Entities|Entities]].

=== Dynamic Readers

Recursive calls are widespread during parsing, and Om.next makes it even easier by providing the current parser as part of the environment. The problem is that if you just call the same parser recursively, there is no chance to change how the reading process operates. To enable this to happen, `pathom` makes the reader part of the environment, this way you can replace the read function when doing a recursive parse call, for example:

```clojure
(ns pathom-dynamic-reader
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(defn user-reader [{:keys [ast]}]
  (let [key (get ast :dispatch-key)]
    (case key
      :name "Saul"
      :family "Goodman")))

(defn root-reader [{:keys [ast query parser] :as env}]
  (let [key (get ast :dispatch-key)]
    (case key
      :current-user (parser (assoc env ::p/reader user-reader) query))))

(def parser (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader root-reader})]}))

(parser {} [{:current-user [:name :family]}])
; => {:current-user {:name "Saul" :family "Goodman"}}
```

> Although pathom makes the change of readers possible, after working on a couple of projects I noticed I end up just having some set of readers that work for the entire thing, the support for it is not going away, I'm just trying to make you aware that it's not just because it's there that you should over-use it.

== Error handling

By default, pathom parser will stop if some exception occurs during the parsing process. This is often undesirable if some node fails you still can return the other ones that succeed. You can use the `error-handler-plugin`. This plugin will wrap each read call with a try-catch block, and in case an error occurs, a value of `::p/reader-error` will be placed in that node, while details of it will go in a separate tree, but at the same path. Better an example to demonstrate:

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.error-handling
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(def computed
  ; create a handle key that will trigger an error when called
  {:trigger-error
   (fn [_]
     (throw (ex-info "Error triggered" {:foo "bar"})))})

; a reader that just flows, until it reaches a leaf
(defn flow-reader [{:keys [query] :as env}]
  (if query
    (p/join env)
    :leaf))

(def parser
  (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [computed flow-reader]})
                          ; add the error handler plugin
                          p/error-handler-plugin]}))

(parser {} [{:go [:key {:nest [:trigger-error :other]}
                  :trigger-error]}])
; =>
; {:go {:key :leaf
;       :nest {:trigger-error :com.wsscode.pathom.core/reader-error
;              :other :leaf}
;       :trigger-error :com.wsscode.pathom.core/reader-error}
;  :com.wsscode.pathom.core/errors {[:go :nest :trigger-error] "class clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Error triggered - {:foo \"bar\"}"
;                                   [:go :trigger-error] "class clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Error triggered - {:foo \"bar\"}"}}
```

As you can see, when an error occurs, the key `::p/errors` will be added to the returned map, containing the detailed error message indexed by the error path. You can customize how the error is exported in this map by setting the key `::p/process-error` in your environment:

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.error-handling-process
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(def computed
  ; create a handle key that will trigger an error when called
  {:trigger-error
   (fn [_]
     (throw (ex-info "Error triggered" {:foo "bar"})))})

; a reader that just flows, until it reaches a leaf
(defn flow-reader [{:keys [query] :as env}]
  (if query
    (p/join env)
    :leaf))

; our error processing function
(defn process-error [env err]
  ; if you use some error reporting service, this is a good place
  ; to trigger a call to then, here you have the error and the full
  ; environment of when it ocurred, so you might want to some extra
  ; information like the query and the current path on it so you can
  ; replay it for debugging

  ; we are going to simply return the error message from the error
  ; if you want to return the same thing as the default, use the
  ; function (p/error-str err)
  (.getMessage err))

(def parser
  (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [computed flow-reader]
                                         ; add the error processing to the environment
                                         ::p/process-error process-error})
                          ; add the error handler plugin
                          p/error-handler-plugin]}))

(parser {} [{:go [:key {:nest [:trigger-error :other]}
                  :trigger-error]}])
; =>
; {:go {:key :leaf
;       :nest {:trigger-error :com.wsscode.pathom.core/reader-error
;              :other :leaf}
;       :trigger-error :com.wsscode.pathom.core/reader-error}
;  :com.wsscode.pathom.core/errors {[:go :nest :trigger-error] "Error triggered"
;                                   [:go :trigger-error]       "Error triggered"}}
```

=== Fail fast

Having each node being caught is great for the UI, but not so much for testing. During testing you probably prefer the parser to blow up as fast as possible so you don't accumulate a bunch of errors that get impossible to read. Having to create a different parser to remove the `error-handler-plugin` can be annoying, so there is an option to solve that. Send the key `::p/fail-fast?` as true in the environment, and the try/catch will not be done, making it fail as soon as an exception fires, for example, using our previous parser:

```clojure
(parser {::p/fail-fast? true}
        [{:go [:key {:nest [:trigger-error :other]}
               :trigger-error]}])
; => CompilerException clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Error triggered {:foo "bar"}, ...
```

== Dispatch helpers

Using multi-methods is a good way to make open readers, `pathom` provides helpers for two common dispatch strategies:
`key-dispatch` and `entity-dispatch`. Here is a pattern that I often use on parsers:

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.dispatch-helpers
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(def cities
  {"Recife"    {:city/name "Recife" :city/country "Brazil"}
   "São Paulo" {:city/name "São Paulo" :city/country "Brazil"}})

(def city->neighbors
  {"Recife" [{:neighbor/name "Boa Viagem"}
             {:neighbor/name "Piedade"}
             {:neighbor/name "Casa Amarela"}]})

; this will dispatch according to the ast dispatch-key
(defmulti computed p/key-dispatch)

; use virtual attributes to handle data not present on the maps, like computed attributes, relationships, and globals
(defmethod computed :city/neighbors [env]
  (let [name (p/entity-attr! env :city/name)]
    (p/join-seq env (city->neighbors name))))

; an example of global, same as before but without any dependency on the entity
(defmethod computed :city/all [env]
  (p/join-seq env (vals cities)))

; remember to return ::p/continue by default so non-handled cases can flow
(defmethod computed :default [_] ::p/continue)

; just to make easy to re-use, our base entity reader consists of a map reader + virtual attributes
(def entity-reader [p/map-reader computed])

; dispatch for entity keys, eg: [:user/by-id 123]
(defmulti entity-lookup p/entity-dispatch)

(defmethod entity-lookup :city/by-name [env]
  ; the ident-value helper extracts the value part from the ident, as "Recife" in [:city/by-name "Recife"]
  (let [city (get cities (p/ident-value env))]
    (p/join city env)))

(defmethod entity-lookup :default [_] ::p/continue)

(def parser
  (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [p/map-reader computed entity-lookup]})]}))

(parser {} [{:city/all [:city/name]}
            {[:city/by-name "Recife"] [:city/neighbors]}])
; =>
;{:city/all [#:city{:name "Recife"} #:city{:name "São Paulo"}]
; [:city/by-name "Recife"] #:city{:neighbors [#:neighbor{:name "Boa Viagem"}
;                                             #:neighbor{:name "Piedade"}
;                                             #:neighbor{:name "Casa Amarela"}]}}
```

== Request caching

As your queries grow, there are more and more optimizations that you can do avoid unnecessary IO or heavy computations. Here we are going to talk about a `request cache`, which is a fancy name for an atom that is initialized on every query and stays on the environment so you can share the cache across nodes. Let's see how we can use that to speed up our query processing:

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.request-cache
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(defn my-expensive-operation [env]
  ; the cache key can be anything; if we were had an extra
  ; variable here, like some id, a good cache key would be
  ; like: [::my-expensive-operation id]
  (p/cached env :my-key
    ; we are going to send an atom with an int so that we can count
    ; how many times this was called
    (let [counter (:counter env)]
      ; a secondary sign if cache is working, let's make a delay
      (Thread/sleep 1000)
      ; increment and return
      (swap! counter inc))))

(def computed
  {:cached my-expensive-operation})

; a reader that just flows, until it reaches a leaf
(defn flow-reader [{:keys [query] :as env}]
  (if query
    (p/join env)
    :leaf))

(def parser
  (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [computed
                                                     flow-reader]})
                          ; add the request cache plugin for cache initialization
                          p/request-cache-plugin]}))

(time
  (parser {:counter (atom 0)}
          [:x :y :cached
           {:z [:foo {:bar [:cached]} :cached]}]))
; "Elapsed time: 1006.760165 msecs"
; =>
; {:x      :leaf
;  :y      :leaf
;  :cached 1
;  :z      {:foo    :leaf
;           :bar    {:cached 1}
;           :cached 1}}
```

Remember this cache is **per request**, so after a full query gets finished, the atom is discarded. If you want to make a cache that's more durable (that retains information across requests), check the [[Plugins|Plugins]] documentation for more information on how to do that.

== Plugins

Since `1.0.0-beta-8`, pathom included a plugin support. Plugins set code that wraps some of pathom operations, a plugin is a map where you bind keys from event names to functions. They work on `wrap` fashion, kind like `ring` wrappers. Here is what a plugin looks like:

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.plugin-example
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(def my-plugin
  ; the ::p/wrap-parser entry point wraps the entire parser,
  ; this means it wraps the operation that runs once on each
  ; query that runs with the parser
  {::p/wrap-parser
   (fn [parser]
     ; here you can initialize stuff that runs only once per
     ; parser, like a durable cache across requests
     (fn [env tx]
       ; here you could initialize per-request items, things
       ; that needs to be set up once per query as we do on
       ; request cache, or the error atom to accumulate errors

       ; in this case, we are doing nothing, just calling the
       ; previous parser, a pass-through wrapper if you may
       (parser env tx)))

   ; this wraps the read function, meaning it will run once for
   ; each recursive parser call that happens during your query
   ::p/wrap-read
   (fn [reader]
     (fn [env]
       ; here you can wrap the parse read, in pathom we use this
       ; on the error handler to do the try/catch per node, also
       ; the profiler use this point to calculate the time spent
       ; on a given node

       ; this is also a good point to inject custom read keys if
       ; you need to, the profile plugin, for example, can capture
       ; the key ::p.profile/profile and export the current profile
       ; information
       (reader env)))})
```

The plugin engine replaces the old `process-reader` in a much more powerful way. If you want to check a real example look for the source for the built-in plugins, they are quite small and yet powerful tools (grep for `-plugin` on the repository to find all of them).

=== Shard switch

For a more practical example, let's say we are routing in a micro-service architecture and our parser needs to be shard-aware. Let's write a plugin that anytime it sees a `:shard` param on a query; and it will update the `:shard` attribute on the environment and send it now, providing that shard information for any node down the line.

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.plugin-shard
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

; a reader that just flows, until it reaches a leaf
(defn flow-reader [{:keys [query] :as env}]
  (if query
    (p/join env)
    :leaf))

(def shard-reader
  ; Clojure neat tricks, let's just fetch the shard
  ; from the environment when :current-shard is asked
  {:current-shard :shard})

(def shard-plugin
  {::p/wrap-read
   (fn [reader]
     (fn [env]
       ; try to get a new shard from the query params
       (let [new-shard (get-in env [:ast :params :shard])]
         (reader (cond-> env new-shard (assoc :shard new-shard))))))})

(def parser
  (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [shard-reader flow-reader]})
                          ; use our shard plugin
                          shard-plugin]}))

(parser {:shard "global"}
        '[:a :b :current-shard
          {(:go-s1 {:shard "s1"})
           ; notice it flows down
           [:x :current-shard {:y [:current-shard]}]}
          :c
          {(:go-s2 {:shard "s2"})
           [:current-shard
            ; we can override at any point
            {(:now-s3 {:shard "s3"})
             [:current-shard]}]}])
; =>
; {:a             :leaf
;  :b             :leaf
;  :current-shard "global"
;  :go-s1         {:x :leaf :current-shard "s1" :y {:current-shard "s1"}}
;  :c             :leaf
;  :go-s2         {:current-shard "s2" :now-s3 {:current-shard "s3"}}}
```

== Testing #TODO

== Placeholders

There is one issue that some people stumbled upon while using Om.next; the problem happens when you need to display two or more different views of the same item as siblings (regarding query arrangement, not necessarily DOM siblings), how do you make this query?

For example, let's say you have two different components to display a user profile, one that shows just the username, and another one with its photo.

```clojure
(om/defui ^:once UserTextView
  static om/IQuery
  (query [_] [:user/name]))

(om/defui ^:once UserImageView
  static om/IQuery
  (query [_] [:user/photo-url]))

(om/defui ^:once UserViewsCompare
  static om/IQuery
  ;; We want to query for both, what we place here?
  (query [_] [{:app/current-user [???]}]))
```

You might be tempted to `concat` the queries, and in case you don’t have to nest like we do here, that may even look like it’s working, but let me break this illusion for you; because it’s not. When you use om/get-query it’s not just the query that’s returned; it also contains meta-data telling from which component that query came from.

This information is important, `om` uses to index your structure and enables incremental updates. When you `concat` the queries, you lose this, and as a consequence, when you try to run a mutation later that touches those items you will have a **“No queries exist at the intersection of component path”** thrown in your face.

[This problem is still in discussion on the om repository](https://github.com/omcljs/om/issues/823). So far the best way I know to handle this is to use placeholder nodes, so let’s learn how to manage those cases properly.

What we need is to be able to branch out the different queries, this is my suggestion on how to write the `UserViewsCompare` query:

```clojure
(om/defui ^:once UserViewsCompare
  static om/IQuery
  ;; By having extra possible branches we keep the path information working
  (query [_] [{:app/current-user [{:ph/text-view (om/get-query UserTextView)}
                                  {:ph/image-view (om/get-query UserImageView)}]}]))
```

The trick is to create a convention about placeholder nodes, in this case, we choose the namespace ph to represent “placeholder nodes”, so when the query asks for `:ph/something` we should just do a recursive call, but staying at the same logical position in terms of parsing, as if we had stayed on the same node.

You can use the `p/placeholder-reader` to implement this pattern on your parser:

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.placeholder
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(def user
  {:user/name      "Walter White"
   :user/photo-url "http://retalhoclub.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1-3.jpg"})

(def computed
  {:app/current-user
   (fn [env]
     (p/join user env))})

(def parser (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [p/map-reader
                                                               computed
                                                               ; placeholder reader
                                                               (p/placeholder-reader "ph")]})]}))

(parser {} [{:app/current-user [{:ph/text-view [:user/name]}
                                {:ph/image-view [:user/photo-url]}]}])
; #:app{:current-user #:ph{:text-view #:user{:name "Walter White"},
;                          :image-view #:user{:photo-url "http://retalhoclub.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1-3.jpg"}}}
```

== Profiling

It's good to know how your queries are performing, and breaking it down by nodes is an excellent level to reason about how your queries are doing. Pathom provides a plugin to make this measurement easy to do:

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.profile
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]
            [com.wsscode.pathom.profile :as p.profile]))

(def computed
  ; to demo delays, this property will take some time
  {:expensive (fn [{:keys [query] :as env}]
                (Thread/sleep 300)
                (if query
                  (p/join env)
                  :done))})

(defn flow-reader [{:keys [query] :as env}]
  (if query
    (p/join env)
    :leaf))

; starting the parser as usual
(def parser
  (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [computed flow-reader]})
                          ; include the profile plugin
                          p.profile/profile-plugin]}))

(parser {}
        ; run the things
        [:a :b {:expensive [:c :d {:e [:expensive]}]}
         ; profile plugin provide this key, when you ask for it you get the
         ; information, be sure to request this as the last item on your query
         ::p.profile/profile])
; =>
; {:a                  :leaf
;  :b                  :leaf
;  :expensive          {:c :leaf
;                       :d :leaf
;                       :e {:expensive :done}}
;  ::p.profile/profile {:a         0
;                       :b         0
;                       :expensive {:c               1
;                                   :d               0
;                                   :e               {:expensive 304
;                                                     ::p.profile/self 304}
;                                   ::p.profile/self 611}}}
```

Looking at the profile results, you see the query values, and at the edges is the `ms` time taken to process that node. When the node has children, a `::p.profile/self` indicates the time for the node itself (including children).

If you like to print a flame-graph of this output, you can use some d3 libraries on the web, I recommend the [d3 flame graph from spierman](https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph). Pathom has a function to convert the profile data to the format accepted by that library:

```clojure
(-> (parser {}
            ; let's add more things this time
            [:a {:b [:g {:expensive [:f]}]}
             {:expensive [:c :d {:e [:expensive]}]}
             ::p.profile/profile])
    ; get the profile
    ::p.profile/profile
    ; generate the name/value/children format
    p.profile/profile->nvc)
; =>
; {:name     "Root"
;  :value    910
;  :children [{:name ":a" :value 0}
;             {:name     ":b"
;              :value    305
;              :children [{:name ":g" :value 0} {:name ":expensive" :value 304 :children [{:name ":f" :value 1}]}]}
;             {:name     ":expensive"
;              :value    605
;              :children [{:name ":c" :value 0}
;                         {:name ":d" :value 1}
;                         {:name ":e" :value 301 :children [{:name ":expensive" :value 300}]}]}]}
```

And then use that data to generate the flame graph:

== Path tracking

As you go deep in your parser `pathom` track record of the current path taken, it's available at `::p/path` at any time. It's a vector containing the current path from the root, the current main use for it is regarding error reporting and profiling.

```clojure
(ns pathom-docs.path-tracking
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]))

(def where-i-am-reader
  {:where-am-i (fn [{::p/keys [path]}] path)})

; a reader that just flows, until it reaches a leaf
(defn flow-reader [{:keys [query] :as env}]
  (if query
    (p/join env)
    :leaf))

(def parser (p/parser {::p/plugins [(p/env-plugin {::p/reader [where-i-am-reader
                                                               flow-reader]})]}))

(parser {} [{:hello [:some {:friend [:place :where-am-i]}]}])
;=>
;{:hello {:some   :leaf
;         :friend {:place      :leaf
;                  :where-am-i [:hello :friend :where-am-i]}}}
```
